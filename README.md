# Concert-Barrels
IT Product Design Product, Aarhus University 2013

Third place at NUMA 2013 at the Mindtrek conference in Tampere, Finland.

# What it's about 
The project was made with Jens Emil Grønbæk and Morten Birk. THe barrels were developed with a mini game, a quiz and the possibility of deciding which music shoud be played leading up to concerts at a small venue in Aarhus called Radar. The interaction was based on placing a beer on top of a barrel. We had fiducials mounted on the beer to track its placement with a Playstaion 3 camera. The user interface was made with a projector. Processing was the language used as it had some nice animations suited for the task. Processing is influenced by Java and works with the Arduino series.
